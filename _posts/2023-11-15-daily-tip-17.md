## Tip of the day #17

Stop imposing and start to declare your code. Declarative expressions are key to parallelism, 
so you need to learn this path. 

“This is the way”

### Declarative vs Imperative Programming

Imperative Programming is HOW the program does, step by step, sequence of commands. 

Look at this piece of code (thanks to Russel Winder) :


```java
List<Integer> squareImperative(final List<Integer> datum) {
    var result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    for (var i = 0; i < datum.size(); i++) {
        result.add(i, datum.get(i) * datum.get(i));
    }
    return result;
}
```

Declarative Programming is WHAT the program does, the expression, 
without explicitly specifying its control flow.

The same result before, but using parallelStream:


```java
List<Integer> squareDeclarative(final List<Integer> datum) {
    return datum.parallelStream()
        .map(i -> i * i)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

Venkat Subramaniam has a book called “Functional Programming in Java”
 where he mentions the benefits of declarative programming:

* Nicely composed, not cluttered
* Free of low-level operations
* Easier to enhance or change the logic
* Iteration controlled by a library of methods
* Efficient; lazy evaluation of loops
* Easier to parallelize where desired

Cool right?  =D
