## Tip of the day #19

Use the joining collector and stop to write loops to concatenate strings.


### What is it?

The joining collector is a new collector that was introduced in Java 8. 
It is a special collector that is used to concatenate strings. 

We have 3 different ways to use it:

1 - join all strings without any delimiter

```java
// 1
String result = Stream.of("a", "b", "c")
    .collect(Collectors.joining());
// abc
```

2 - join all strings with a delimiter

```java
// 2
String result = Stream.of("a", "b", "c")
    .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
// a, b, c
```

3 - join all strings with a delimiter and a prefix and suffix

```java
// 3
String result = Stream.of("a", "b", "c")
    .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "[", "]"));
// [a, b, c]
```
Important to note that all then join the strings in the same order that they are in the stream.

They are also null-safe, so if you have a null value in the stream, it will be ignored.

After today, do not use more StringBuilders to concatenate strings anymore, use the joining collector instead.

### How to

Take a look in [repo-tip-19](https://github.com/brunobaiano/tip-of-the-day/tree/main/tip-19) to see a real example of today's tip.

Because @QuarkusTest and @ParameterizedTest has some issues, I created a new repo to show the example using Spring Boot.
Here we can use records.
