## Daily tip #8


If you are using JDK 16 or above,  try to use Records to model your DTOs - immutability is free.

### More info:

Records started in JDK 14 [as a preview feature](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359), and it was [finalized in JDK 16](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395).

#### Goals
* Devise an object-oriented construct that expresses a simple aggregation of values.

* Help developers to focus on modeling immutable data rather than extensible behavior.

* Automatically implement data-driven methods such as equals and accessors.

* Preserve long-standing Java principles such as nominal typing and migration compatibility.

A record declaration specifies in a header a description of its contents; the appropriate accessors, constructor, equals, hashCode, and toString methods are created automatically. 
A record's fields are final because the class is intended to serve as a simple "data carrier".
