## Tip of the day #13

If you are using JUnit5, try to add @Tag annotation in your tests. 
You can configure your pipeline to use it, and skip or run your custom tags. 
Start with @Tag(“IntegrationTests”) and happy testing!

### History

JUnit 5 introduced the concept of tags, which are essentially labels that you can add to your tests.
You can then use these tags to filter which tests to run or ignore.

````java
@Tag("IntegrationTests")
class MyIntegrationTests {
    @Test
    void test1() {
        // ...
    }

    @Test
    void test2() {
        // ...
    }
}
````

You can then run only the tests with a given tag by using the `--include-tag` option:

````
$ mvn test -Dgroups="IntegrationTests"
````

Similarly, we can exclude tests with a given tag by using the `--exclude-tag` option:

````
$ mvn test -Dgroups="UnitTests" -DexcludedGroups="IntegrationTests"
````

Or you can use JUnit and create a test suit.
