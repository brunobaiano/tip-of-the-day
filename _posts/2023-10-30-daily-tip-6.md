## Tip of the day #6
Don’t use the agile principle “Working software over comprehensive documentation” to not create a good documentation. Don’t you know how to start? Try the C4 model from Simon Brown and c4builder to help you create the diagrams.


## More info


The C4 model is a way to document and communicate the architecture of a software system using four types of diagrams: context, containers, components, and code¹. The model is based on the idea of using abstractions to represent different levels of detail and different audiences². The model is also notation and tooling independent, meaning that you can use any symbols or tools to create the diagrams¹.

The context diagram shows how the software system interacts with the people and other systems in its environment. The container diagram zooms into the software system and shows the high-level technical building blocks, such as web servers, databases, mobile apps, etc. The component diagram zooms into a single container and shows the components inside it, such as classes, modules, services, etc. The code diagram zooms into a single component and shows how it is implemented using code elements, such as classes, methods, functions, etc¹.

The C4 model is useful for describing and communicating software architecture in a simple and effective way. It helps to avoid the problems of complex or incomplete documentation that can make it hard to understand and maintain the software system². The C4 model also supports different perspectives and scenarios, such as dynamic behavior, deployment, security, etc³.
